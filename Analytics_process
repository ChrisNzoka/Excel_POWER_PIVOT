# Turn it on

Power Pivot requires an add-in in Excel. This is already available in our
standard Excel application, so we just need to enable it.

### 1

Enable the Microsoft Power Pivot for Excel add-in from the Excel Options menu:
Click on File > Options > Add-ins. Next to the Manage drop-down menu, select COM
add-ins, then click Go… Check the box for Microsoft Power Pivot for Excel, then
click OK.

# Preparing data with Power Query

The best way to get data is to use Power Query. This is because Power Query has
the ability to shape and clean up data before we begin analyzing it in Power
Pivot.

1: First, launch the Power Query Editor to get started.

2: Use Power Query to import 'sales_team_directory.xlsx' from the Datasets
folder.

3: Use Power Query to import loan_data.xlsx from the Datasets.

4: California's state code should be CA, but it's been overwritten by the
number 8. Let's fix this.

Under the state_code column, replace the 8 values with CA.

5: Great! Let's review our data to understand what it looks like. Enabling the
data preview features in Power Query is a great way to gain deeper insight.
Enable these features under the View ribbon:

- Column quality
- Column distribution
- Column profile

# Manage data in Power Pivot

We've prepared our data with Power Query, now we need to add this to our data
model so we can use it in Power Pivot. We can also add data from our workbooks
directly to Power Pivot as an easy solution!

- If you are still in the Power Query Editor:

Click on the Close & Load dropdown menu > Close and load to… Select Only Create
Connection. Check Add this data to the Data Model. Click OK.

- If the data has already been loaded into the workbook:

Navigate to the Data ribbon and click Queries & Connections. Right click on a
query > Load To… Select Only Create Connection. Check Add this data to the Data
Model. Click OK. Click OK on the warning. Do this for both sales_team and
loan_data.
